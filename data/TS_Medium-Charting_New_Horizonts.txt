Why Cardano?

To thrive in DeFi, a protocol needs scalability, interoperability, trust, and security. Cardano offers all this and more. TangleSwap chose Cardano for its robust tech and the Milkomeda Wrapped Smart Contracts for a native Cardano-EVM blend.

Cardano's vibrant community and diverse ecosystem are vital to TangleSwap's mission.

Unlocking a New Tokenomic Model

Expanding to high-value ecosystems increases Total Value Locked and trading volume, boosting revenue. TangleSwap's unique token emissions mechanism balances token flow, creating a liquid hedged index. It also enhances interoperability, unifying resources across ecosystems.
